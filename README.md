Flappy Curses
=============

Flappy Bird with the ncurses library.

This is more of an exercise to learn roughly how ncurses works rather than a
failthful port of Flappy Bird.

Currently missing the current minor features:

* Restart on death
* Score printing as you go
* Proper pipe generation (currently come out in "chunks")
* High score keeping

Requirements
------------
* ncurses

Use something like

    sudo apt-get install libncurses-dev

to install the ncurses library
